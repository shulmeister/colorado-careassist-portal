## Section 3: Key Features the Marketing Team Must Know

### Feature 1: Family Room Portal (Major Sales Differentiator)

**What It Is:**
A free, secure online portal where client families can stay connected to their loved one's care.

**Family Portal Capabilities:**

| Feature | Description | Marketing Message |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Care Calendar** | View upcoming caregiver visits, times, assigned caregivers | "See exactly who's coming and when" |
| **Shift Notes** | Read detailed notes from each caregiver visit | "Know how Mom is doing after every visit" |
| **Bill Pay** | View invoices, make payments, split costs among family members | "Transparent billing, easy payment options" |
| **Secure Access** | HITRUST-certified security, HIPAA compliant | "Your family's information is protected" |

**Sales Conversation Application:**
"When your caregiver finishes a visit with your mother, you'll receive detailed notes about how she's doing - what she ate, her mood, any concerns. You can see this in real-time through our Family Room Portal. No more wondering, no more waiting for callbacks."

**Competitive Advantage:**
Many smaller agencies use basic scheduling software without family-facing portals. This is a genuine differentiator when families compare providers.

### Feature 2: Electronic Visit Verification (EVV)

**What It Is:**
GPS-verified electronic tracking that confirms exactly when caregivers arrive and leave each client visit.

**EVV Compliance:**
- 85% state compatibility (covers Colorado and VA requirements)
- Integrates with HHAeXchange, Sandata, NetSmart, AuthentiCare
- Mandatory for Medicaid-funded services in most states

**Marketing Message:**
"Every visit is verified - you know exactly when your caregiver arrived and departed. Our GPS-enabled system ensures complete accountability for every hour of care."

**Competitive Advantage:**
Some agencies still use paper timesheets or basic punch systems. EVV demonstrates technological sophistication and accountability.

### Feature 3: TeamEngage Caregiver Recognition (Powered by Ava)

A caregiver recognition and rewards program that provides gift cards and incentives for performance excellence.

**How It Works:**

**Capabilities:**

- Schedule balance analysis (prevent burnout)
- Early identification of performance issues

**Marketing Application:**
"We use advanced analytics to monitor care quality - not just hours worked, but the quality of every interaction. Our data-driven approach means problems are identified before they affect your family."

**Marketing Message (Advanced/Sophisticated Families):**
"Our predictive analytics platform monitors for early warning signs that could indicate health changes. We don't just react to problems - we work to prevent them."

**Caution:** This is an advanced feature. Use judiciously with families who appreciate data-driven care approaches.

### Feature 6: First-Come, Self-Serve Scheduling

**What It Is:**
Allows qualified caregivers to self-select available shifts they're qualified for.

## Section 8: Sales Objection Handling

### Common Objections & Technology-Based Responses

**Objection: "How do I know the caregiver actually shows up?"**

Response: "Great question. Every caregiver uses our mobile app to clock in when they arrive at your home. The app uses GPS to verify their location, so we know exactly when they arrived and when they left. You can even see this in your Family Portal. It's called Electronic Visit Verification, and it's built into our WellSky platform."

**Objection: "How will I know how my mother is doing?"**

Response: "After every visit, your caregiver documents detailed notes about the visit - what your mother ate, her mood, activities, any concerns. These notes are immediately available in your Family Room Portal. You'll never have to wonder or wait for a callback. Most families tell us this transparency is one of the things they value most."

**Objection: "Is my family's information secure?"**

Response: "Absolutely. We use WellSky Personal Care, which is the only home care platform with HITRUST security certification - that's the same security standard used by major hospitals and health insurance companies. Your family's information is protected at the highest level in our industry."

**Objection: "You seem like a small local company - can you really handle this?"**

Response: "I understand that concern. While we're locally owned and operated, we've invested in the same enterprise-grade technology used by the largest home care providers in America. WellSky Personal Care powers over 4,000 agencies and handles 1 in 3 home care visits in the US. You get local, personalized service backed by world-class infrastructure."
