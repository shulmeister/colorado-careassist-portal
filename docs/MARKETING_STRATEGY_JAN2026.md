# Strategic Priorities

## Priority 1: Fix Google Ads (Immediate)

### Problem
You are spending $1,167/month on Google Ads with a 0.1 ROAS. The converting search terms reveal the issue - you're capturing people searching for the VA itself, not home care services.

"va community care phone number colorado" and "veterans administration" are navigational queries. These people want to call the VA, not hire a home care agency.

### Negative Keywords to Add TODAY

```
-"phone number"
-"address"
-"hours"
-"login"
-"claim"
-"status"
-"form"
-"application"
-"jobs"
-"careers"
-"employment"
-"va hospital"
-"va clinic"
-"va appointment"
-"myhealthevet"
```

### Keywords to PAUSE (High Spend, Wrong Intent)

| Keyword | Spend | Conversions | Action |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|
| "va colorado springs" | $95.27 | 0 | PAUSE |
| "va community care colorado" | $56.43 | 0 | PAUSE |
| "va community care contact" | $54.64 | 0 | PAUSE |
| "va community care phone number colorado" | $96.59 | 1 | PAUSE (navigational) |
| "veterans administration" | $78.89 | 1 | PAUSE (too broad) |

**Total Wasted Spend:** ~$400/month (34% of budget)

### Keywords to ADD (High Intent)

**Tier 1 - Highest Intent (Exact Match, Bid $8-12):**
```
[veteran home care colorado]
[va aid and attendance colorado]
[home care for veterans colorado springs]
[non-medical home care veterans]
[in-home care for veterans colorado]
```

**Tier 2 - Service-Specific:**
```
"veteran caregiver services colorado"
"va homemaker services colorado"
"veteran companion care"
"elderly veteran care at home"
"disabled veteran home assistance"
```

**Tier 3 - Benefit-Focused:**
```
"aid and attendance benefit help"
"va pension home care"
"housebound benefit colorado"
"veteran benefits for home care"
```

### Device Optimization

| Device | Current Spend | Conv Rate | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | $1,037 (89%) | 7.46% | Reduce bid 20-25% |
| Desktop | $121 (10%) | 12.50% | Increase bid 25% |
| Tablet | $9 (1%) | 0% | Reduce bid 50% |

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce wasted spend by 40-50%
- Improve ROAS to 2.0+ within 60 days
- Target CPA: $35-50 (vs current $195)

## Priority 2: Exploit Website Conversion Advantage

### The Insight
A 42.5% website conversion rate is extraordinary. Your website works perfectly - the problem is traffic volume (only 47 users/month).

| `/aid-and-attendance-colorado/` | "aid and attendance colorado" | 320 |
| `/va-community-care-home-services/` | "va community care home care" | 110 |
| `/housebound-benefit-colorado/` | "housebound benefit" | 140 |

**Priority 2 - Local Landing Pages:**
```
/home-care-colorado-springs/
/home-care-denver/
/home-care-boulder/
/home-care-fountain-co/
/home-care-monument-co/
```

### GBP Optimization Checklist

# Red Flags & Concerns

## 1. Traffic-to-Spend Imbalance
You spent $1,167 on Google Ads but only had 47 website users total. Audit Google Ads to GA4 connection.

## 2. Geographic Mismatch
GBP locations are in Colorado Springs, but top GA4 city is Denver. Consider Denver expansion.

## 3. Career Page Traffic
12 sessions on Careers page (17% of traffic) - add "jobs/careers/hiring" as negative keywords.

## 4. Email Campaign Stagnation
Only targeting "Wealth Leads - South" segment. Expand to multiple segments with monthly nurture.

## 5. Attribution Discrepancy
Google Ads shows 6 conversions, GA4 shows 20. Audit tracking setup.
