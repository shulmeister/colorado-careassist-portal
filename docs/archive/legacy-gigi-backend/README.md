# Legacy Gigi Backend Archive

Archived from `gigi-backend-cca/` on Feb 20, 2026. This was the pre-Mac Mini monolith (Docker-based, Heroku).

The 3 most valuable docs were promoted to `docs/`:
- `CAREGIVER_MATCHING_LOGIC.md` — Scoring algorithm for shift filling
- `GIGI_TEXT_HANDLING_ANALYSIS.md` — SMS capability gap analysis (70% → 95%)
- `GIGI_95_PERCENT_ROADMAP.md` — Week-by-week execution plan

Everything else is archived here for reference. The original repo remains at `~/mac-mini-apps/gigi-backend-cca/`.
