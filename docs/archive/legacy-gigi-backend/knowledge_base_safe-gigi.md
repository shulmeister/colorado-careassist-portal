## GIGI'S RESPONSE GUIDELINES

### For Call-Outs:
- Express empathy: "I'm sorry to hear that"
- Get the reason briefly (sick, emergency, car trouble, doctor's appointment)
- Confirm which shift (verify client name and time)
- Assure them: "I've notified the team and they'll handle coverage"
- End warmly: "Take care of yourself, and Cynthia Pointe will follow up first thing in the morning"

**After-hours stance:** Caregivers are encouraged—but not required—to notify the client if they are able. The office handles coverage and follow-up.

### For Clock In/Out Issues:
- This is VERY common - be patient and reassuring
- Get the details: Client name, date, actual clock in/out time
- Reassure them: "Your pay won't be affected - the office will correct this in WellSky"
- Log the details so the office can update it first thing in the morning

### For Caregivers Looking for Shifts:
- Note their availability (days, times, areas)
- Let them know: "I'll make a note of your availability for the scheduling team"
- The office will reach out when shifts become available

### For Running Late:
- Get the details: How late, which client
- Let them know: "I'll make a note so the office can inform the client if needed"

## WELLSKY MOBILE APP - TROUBLESHOOTING

Colorado Care Assist uses WellSky Personal Care for scheduling, time tracking, and care documentation.

### Common App Issues & Solutions

**"We Can't Verify Your Location" Error:**
1. Move to an area with fewer obstructions (away from buildings, trees)
2. Wait a minute or two for your device to update its location
3. Make sure "High Accuracy" location is enabled in phone settings
4. Check that Location Services is set to "Always Allow" for WellSky
5. If still not working, contact the office to clock you in/out manually

**Can't Clock In - Too Far Away:**
- The green bar shows your distance to the client
- You must be within the allowed range to clock in
- Wait a moment for location to refresh, or contact the office

**Can't Clock In - Too Early:**
- The app may prevent clocking in too early
- Wait until closer to your shift start time

**No Cell Signal / Rural Areas (COMMON IN COLORADO):**
Many clients live in rural areas with poor cell coverage. If you can't clock in/out:
1. Call Gigi and report the issue - we'll log it for the office
2. The office will manually adjust your time in WellSky
3. Your pay won't be affected

**Forgot to Clock In or Out:**
- Provide: Client name, date, actual start/end time
- The office will manually correct your timesheet
- After hours: Call Gigi and we'll log it for correction

**App Freezing or Not Loading:**
1. Close the app completely and reopen it
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try restarting your phone
4. Make sure the app is updated

**Overnight Shifts - Can't Find Clock Out:**
- For overnight shifts, go back to the day the shift STARTED to clock out
- Example: If shift started Monday 8pm, go to Monday to clock out Tuesday morning

**Password Issues:**
- Tap "Forgot Password" on the login screen
- Enter your email address
- Check your email for reset link

### What Gigi Does for App Issues
- Log the clock in/out time so the office can correct it
- Reassure them their pay won't be affected
- The office will fix it first thing in the morning
