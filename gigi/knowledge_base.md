### Common App Issues & Troubleshooting

**"We Can't Verify Your Location" Error:**
This happens when the app can't determine your GPS location. Try these steps:
1. Move to an area with fewer obstructions (away from buildings, trees)
2. Wait a minute or two for your device to update its location
3. Make sure "High Accuracy" location is enabled in phone settings
4. Check that Location Services is set to "Always Allow" or "While Using" for the WellSky app
5. If still not working, contact the office to clock you in/out manually

**Can't Clock In - Too Far Away:**
- The green bar at the bottom shows your distance to the client
- You must be within the allowed range to clock in
- If you're at the correct location but it shows too far, your GPS may not have updated
- Wait a moment for location to refresh, or contact the office

**Can't Clock In - Too Early:**
- The app may prevent clocking in too early before your scheduled shift
- Wait until closer to your shift start time

**No Cell Signal / Rural Areas (COMMON IN COLORADO):**
Many clients live in rural areas with poor cell coverage. If you can't clock in/out:
1. **Text or call the office** with your clock in/out time - they will enter it manually
2. After hours: Call Gigi and report the issue - we'll log it for the office
3. The office can always manually adjust your time in WellSky

**Forgot to Clock In or Out:**
- Contact the office as soon as you remember
- Provide: Client name, date, actual start/end time
- The office will manually correct your timesheet in WellSky
- After hours: Call Gigi and we'll log it for correction

**App Freezing or Not Loading:**
1. Close the app completely and reopen it
2. Check your internet connection (WiFi or cellular data)
3. Try restarting your phone
4. Make sure the app is updated to the latest version

**Overnight Shifts - Can't Find Clock Out:**
- For overnight shifts, you must go back to the day the shift STARTED to clock out
- Example: If shift started Monday 8pm, go to Monday to clock out Tuesday morning

**Password Issues:**
- Tap "Forgot Password" on the login screen
- Enter your email address
- Check your email for reset link
- Note: WellSky does not save passwords for security reasons

**Location Services Settings:**
- iPhone: Settings > Privacy > Location Services > WellSky Personal Care > "While Using" or "Always"
- Android: Settings > Apps > WellSky Personal Care > Permissions > Location > "Allow"

### What Gigi Can Do for App Issues
When caregivers call with WellSky app problems after hours:
- **Log the clock in/out time** so the office can correct it first thing in the morning
- **Reassure them** their pay won't be affected - the office will fix it
- **Remind them** to also text the office with their times as a backup

### Real Scenarios (From Actual Calls)

**Location Detection Failure:**
"Liza Martinez called - she's experiencing a clock-out issue again. WellSky can't detect Gerald's location."
→ Log her clock-out time, reassure her the office will update it manually.

**Multiple Caregivers Having Issues:**
"Today several caregivers mentioned having clock-in/clock-out problems."
→ This happens sometimes - log each one with details for the office to correct.

**WellSky Stuck on Loading:**
"My WellSky app is showing Loading only. I can't make any changes."
→ Suggest restarting the app/phone, but if it persists, log their clock in/out times manually.

**Forgot to Clock In:**
"Ladonna forgot to clock in for her shift with Marthe."
→ Get the actual start time, log it for the office to update in WellSky.

**Rural Area - No Signal:**
"I'm at the client's house but there's no cell signal out here in Peyton."
→ This is common in rural Colorado. Log their times and reassure them the office will fix it.

### What Gigi Does When a Caregiver Calls Out
1. Verifies the caregiver's identity
2. Confirms which shift they're calling out from
3. Records the reason
4. Sends urgent notification to on-call manager
5. Logs the call-out for office follow-up

### Shift Coverage Process
- The scheduling team will work to find coverage
- Other caregivers may be contacted to cover the shift

```

### KEY TONE & STYLE NOTES

From these real conversations, Gigi should:
1. **Be brief but warm** - "Thank you for letting us know" not lengthy paragraphs
2. **Acknowledge immediately** - "Got it", "No worries", "Thank you for your response"
3. **Confirm details back** - Repeat the shift time/date/location for clarity
4. **End positively** - "Have a wonderful day!", "Thank you!"
5. **Don't over-apologize** - Simple acknowledgment is fine
6. **Use caregiver's name** - Personal touch matters
7. **Provide next steps** - "I'll update that for you", "Will keep you posted"
