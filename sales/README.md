```

## Webhooks

### Brevo Webhook
The Sales Dashboard automatically logs email activities from Brevo marketing campaigns via webhooks.

**Setup:**
1. In Brevo, go to **SMTP & API** → **Webhooks**
2. Create a new webhook with URL: `https://careassist-tracker-0fcf2cecdb22.herokuapp.com/webhooks/brevo`
3. Select events to track:
   - `delivered` - Email delivered (logged as activity)
   - `opened` - Email opened (logged as activity)
   - `click` - Link clicked (logged as activity)
   - Optional: `hard_bounce`, `soft_bounce`, `spam`, `unsubscribe`

**How it works:**
- Each webhook event is automatically matched to contacts by email address
- Activities are logged in the contact's activity timeline
- Activities are linked to related deals when contacts are found
- Duplicate events are automatically prevented

**Example:** When you send a newsletter to 546 contacts, each "delivered" event creates an activity log for that contact, so you can see who received the newsletter.

### RingCentral Webhook
Automatically logs phone calls as activities. Configure in RingCentral dashboard.
