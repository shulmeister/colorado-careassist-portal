# Gigi: Elite Chief of Staff

Gigi is no longer just a business scheduler. She has been upgraded to a **Full Chief of Staff** capable of handling Jason's personal and business requests with secure, real-world execution.

## 🚀 Key Upgrades (Feb 2026)

### 1. Secure Autonomous Purchasing (2FA)
Gigi can now perform real-world transactions using a secure **Double Confirmation (2FA)** flow:
- **How it works:** When you ask Gigi to buy tickets or book a table, she initiates the request and immediately sends a **Telegram confirmation** to Jason's phone.
- **Security:** She will wait on the call for your verbal "Yes" or "Go ahead" before using any credit card details.
- **Headless Access:** Powered by a **1Password Service Account**, allowing her to retrieve credentials on the Mac Mini without Touch ID or manual intervention.

### 2. Unified Google Intelligence
Gigi now has a "god view" of Jason's digital life:
- **Email:** Searches across `jason@coloradocareassist.com` and `shulmeister@gmail.com` (via forwarded inbox labels).
- **Calendar:** Unified search across **ALL accessible Google Calendars**, providing a complete view of Jason's schedule.

### 3. Business Monitoring & WellSky Sync
Gigi acts as an automated manager for Colorado Care Assist:
- **Chat Monitoring:** Scans RingCentral team chats for client mentions and task completions (Laundry, Cleaning, etc.).
- **Auto-Documentation:** Automatically logs detected tasks and complaints as notes directly in the **WellSky** client file.
- **Proactive Alerts:** Flags high-severity issues and notifies the team immediately.
